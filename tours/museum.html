                <p>Many people do not know that from 14th until 19th century, Dubrovnik was the capital of the small independent city-state, known as the Republic of Ragusa. The rich history of that small city-state is hidden in the city’s museums and waits to be discovered by you. You can choose from the Maritime Museum, the Franciscan museum (with one of the oldest pharmacies in Europe), Rector’s Palace, the Cathedral Treasury, and the Ethnographical museum (formerly the granary of the city-state). Let me know what interests you, and I will create a tour that best suits you. </p>
