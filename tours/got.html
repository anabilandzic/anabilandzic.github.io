                <p>Since Season 2, Dubrovnik has been a main filming location for King’s Landing, the fictional capital of the Seven Kingdoms in the TV show Game of Thrones. During this tour, accompanied by photos, we will follow the footsteps of your favorite characters and discover famous filming locations, such as: -     Red Keep -     Blackwater Bay -     Littlefinger’s brothel -     Cersei’s walk of shame -     Joffrey’s and Margaery’s wedding -     House of the Undying
The end of the tour will be at the official GOT shop where you will have opportunity to grab a souvenir and take a picture on the Iron Throne. *Apart from showing all the Game of Thrones highlights, I will also provide some history of the Old town and the region. </p>
