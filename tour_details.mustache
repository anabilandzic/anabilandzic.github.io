                <p>Just over a month ago, we shipped the long awaited Bootstrap 4 stable release. With a brand new codebase designed to better support customization with all new components and documentation, it was the perfect time to debut some brand new themes built. Today, we’d like to introduce you to our brand new <a href="https://themes.getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap Themes marketplace</a>.</p>

                <p>Over the last several months, we’ve been hard at work with theme creators to build the best themes for you. When we created our original three Bootstrap themes, our goal was to provide the best themes, build tools, documentation, and support to everyone building with Bootstrap. With today’s update, we’re adding 10 new themes to the mix from a global community of designers and developers.</p>

                <p>Every theme is built on Bootstrap 4 (stable, no beta or alpha here!) and comes with its own build tools and customer support. Prices are set by creators with pricing that incentivizes unique and well supported themes. Collectively, this inaugural batch of theme developers have built themes used by over 500,000 people. We’re excited to grow our Themes user base, push the boundaries of premium themes, and help everyone bring their ideas to life on the web.</p>
